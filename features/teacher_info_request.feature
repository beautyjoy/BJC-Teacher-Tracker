Feature: Request additional information for teacher application

  As an admin
  I want to be able to request additional information from teachers
  So that they can update their applications

  Background: Has an Admin in DB
    Given the following teachers exist:
      | first_name | last_name | admin | email                      |
      | Joseph     | Mamoa     | true  | testadminuser@berkeley.edu |

  Scenario: Admin requests more information and teacher sees notification upon login
    Given the following schools exist:
      | name        | city     | state | website                  | grade_level | school_type |
      | UC Berkeley | Berkeley | CA    | https://www.berkeley.edu | university  | public      |
    And the following teachers exist:
      | first_name | last_name | admin | email                    | school      |
      | Joseph     | Mamoa     | false | testteacher@berkeley.edu | UC Berkeley |
    And I am on the BJC home page
    And I have an admin email
    When I follow "Log In"
    Then I can log in with Google
    And I press "‚ùì" on Actions for first teacher
    Then I should see "Reason"
    And I should see "Request Info from Joseph Mamoa"
    And I fill in "request_reason" with "Please provide more details on your teaching experience"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I can send a request info email
    And I follow "Logout"

    Given I am on the BJC home page
    And I have a teacher Google email "testteacher@berkeley.edu"
    And I follow "Log In"
    Then I can log in with Google
    And I should see a "warning" flash message "Your application is requested to be updated. You may update your information. Please check your email for more information."
