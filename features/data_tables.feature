Feature: Admin Data Tables functionality

  As an admin
  So that I can see how many people are teaching BJC
  I can use interactive datatables

  Background: Has an Admin in DB
    Given the following teachers exist:
      | first_name | last_name | admin | email                        |
      | Admin    | User    | true  | testadminuser@berkeley.edu   |

  # Scenario: Updating application status persists changes in database
  #   Given the following schools exist:
  #     |       name      |     country     |     city     |  state  |            website            |  grade_level  |  school_type  |
  #     |   UC Berkeley   |       US        |   Berkeley   |   CA    |   https://www.berkeley.edu    |  university   |     public    |
  #   Given the following teachers exist:
  #     | first_name | last_name  | admin | email                    | school      | snap   | application_status |
  #     | Bobby      | John       | false | testteacher@berkeley.edu | UC Berkeley | bobby  | denied             |
  #   Given I am on the BJC home page
  #   And I have an admin email
  #   And I follow "Log In"
  #   Then I can log in with Google
  #   When I go to the teachers page
  #   And I go to the edit page for Bobby John
  #   And I set my application status as "Validated"
  #   And I press "Update"
  #   Then I see a confirmation "Saved"
  #   When I go to the teachers page
  #   And I check "Validated"
  #   Then I should see "Bobby John"

  # Scenario: Filter all teacher info as an admin
  #   Given the following schools exist:
  #     | name        |     country     | city     | state | website                  | grade_level | school_type |
  #     | UC Berkeley |       US        | Berkeley | CA    | https://www.berkeley.edu | university  | public      |
  #   Given the following teachers exist:
  #     | first_name | last_name  | admin | email                     | school      | application_status |
  #     | Victor     | Validateme | false | testteacher1@berkeley.edu | UC Berkeley |      Validated     |
  #     | Danny      | Denyme     | false | testteacher2@berkeley.edu | UC Berkeley |       Denied       |
  #     | Peter      | Pendme     | false | testteacher3@berkeley.edu | UC Berkeley |     Not Reviewed   |
  #   Given I am on the BJC home page
  #   Given I have an admin email
  #   And   I follow "Log In"
  #   Then  I can log in with Google
  #   When  I go to the teachers page
  #   And   I check "Not Reviewed"
  #   And   I uncheck "Validated"
  #   Then  I should see "Peter"
  #   Then  I should not see "Victor"
  #   Then  I should not see "Danny"
  #   And   I check "Validated"
  #   Then  I should see "Peter"
  #   Then  I should see "Victor"
  #   Then  I should not see "Danny"
