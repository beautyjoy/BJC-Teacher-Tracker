# ============================================================
#
# Run ONCE on a database that already has db:seed applied.
# Adds schools, teachers, PD events, and registrations without
# touching existing data.
#
# Requirements:
#   - A CSV export of schools (schema below)
#   - BACKEND_MAPS_API_KEY with the Geocoding API enabled
#
# Usage:
#   bin/rails "db:staging_seed[/path/to/schools.csv]"
#   bin/rails "db:staging_seed[/path/to/schools.csv,500]"  # limit to 500 schools
#
# CSV column schema:
#   Name, Location, Country, URL, Teachers, Grade Level, Actions
#   (Teachers and Actions columns are ignored)
#
# Other data is scaled proportionally to school count:
#   Teachers         ≈ 1.4 per school (minimum 1 guaranteed)
#   PD Events        ≈ 16% of school count
#   PD Registrations ≈ 3–4 per event

            <p>
              The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a College Board-endorsed AP Computer Science
              Principles curriculum developed at UC Berkeley. BJC emphasizes the creative and
              collaborative aspects of computing, connecting CS to real-world impacts in art, science,
              and society.

            <h2>Assessment</h2>
            <p>
              The AP CS Principles exam includes a performance task (Create Task) and an end-of-course
              exam. BJC's labs are designed to prepare students for both components. See the
              <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles">
              College Board AP CSP page</a> for scoring guidelines and sample responses.

            <h1>AP CS Principles Exam Guide</h1>
            <p>
              This guide summarizes what BJC teachers need to know about the AP CSP exam, College Board
              requirements, and how BJC aligns to the framework.
            </p>
            <h2>Exam Structure</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Create Performance Task (30%)</strong> — students develop a program of their choice and submit a written response. Completed in class prior to the exam date.</li>
              <li><strong>End-of-Course Exam (70%)</strong> — 70 multiple choice questions covering all seven Big Ideas.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>BJC Alignment to the Big Ideas</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Creative Development</li>
              <li>Data</li>
              <li>Algorithms and Programming</li>
              <li>Computer Systems and Networks</li>
              <li>Impact of Computing</li>
            </ol>
            <p>BJC covers all five Big Ideas across its seven units. See the pacing guide on bjc.edc.org for unit-by-Big-Idea mapping.</p>
            <h2>Course Audit</h2>
            <p>
              To offer AP CSP for credit, your course must pass the College Board Course Audit.
              BJC's syllabi are pre-approved — download the endorsed syllabus from the BJC website
              and submit it through AP Classroom.

            <h1>BJC Teacher Tracker — Admin Handbook</h1>
            <p>This page documents processes for admins reviewing teacher applications and managing the tracker.</p>
            <h2>Reviewing Applications</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Navigate to <strong>Teachers → Unreviewed</strong> to see pending applications.</li>
              <li>Check the teacher's school, website, and teaching status for plausibility.</li>
              <li>Set application status to <strong>Validated</strong>, <strong>Denied</strong>, or <strong>Info Needed</strong>.</li>
              <li>Use the Verification Notes field to record your reasoning — especially for denials.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Email & MailBluster</h2>
            <p>
              Validated teachers are synced to MailBluster for newsletter delivery. If a teacher's
              email shows a hard bounce, mark them accordingly and follow up before re-sending.
              Soft bounces may resolve on their own — retry after 48 hours.
            </p>
            <h2>Merging Duplicates</h2>
            <p>
              Duplicate teacher or school records can be merged via the Merge tools in the admin panel.
              Always verify the merge direction (which record is kept) before confirming — merges
              are not reversible.
            </p>
            <h2>Data Export</h2>
            <p>
              A full CSV export of all teachers is available from the Teachers index page.
              Exports include email delivery stats, school info, and application status.
